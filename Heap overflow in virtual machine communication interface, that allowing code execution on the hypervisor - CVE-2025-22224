These vulnerability enable hyperjacking that serve risk allows advisors with local admin privileges to execute on host system for cloud, hosting, and enterprise environments. The Attackers breach any VM escalate to full hypervisor compromise every VM on host.

Check for your  Infrastructure using KQL:

let VirtualMachine_vul =
DeviceInfo
| where IsInternetFacing == true and isnotempty( PublicIP)
| distinct DeviceId;
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where FileName contains "vmtoolsd"
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId
| where DeviceId has_any (VirtualMachine_vul)

Actions to be performed:
- Apply latest VMware security advisory (VMSA-2025-0004) patches.
